# Company

If you want to grant others access to your servers and applications, you need to create a Company. Per default you only have a **Personal** space, here it's not possible to invite users.

To create a company click **Settings** and create a new company.

When you have selected your company, you can invite users under **Settings**

!!! note
    Right now it's only possible to invite users that already have an account, this will change later.

When selecting a company, you will only see servers and apps for that company, and when creating a server, it will only be created under that company.
