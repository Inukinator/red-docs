# What are Vapor Red

Vapor Red is an easy way to manage servers on your own Cloud account. You setup access to your Cloud account through the Red dashboard.
After this, you can start a server in a region of your choice.

When you have booted up your server, you can create and deploy your apps easily from your Git repository.
You can also setup install database servers, Redis server and even setup firewall rules.

You can also link your own custom domain to Vapor Red and create SSL certificates.

If you want more flexibility you can setup your SSH key, and login to the server, and even get Root access.
