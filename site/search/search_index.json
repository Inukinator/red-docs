As it's still early, this roadmap can be subject to change without prior notice. Info From this point, there will be no wiping of any database. Meaning all applications created from now, will exist when we launch Vapor Cloud 2. When launching Cloud 2, if there are any duplicate apps between Cloud 1 and Cloud 2, the ones from Cloud 2 will be renamed to <slug>-v2 Alpha (Launched) \u00b6 The Alpha of Vapor Cloud 2, will serve as an experimental of new features, as we close in on how the release will be. We plan on launching as many of the features needed, in an early stage. More advanced features will come during the Beta phase. Beta (Q4 2018) \u00b6 During the Beta phase, most of the API and features will be locked, here we will also have full backups of all parts of the system, in case of emergency. During beta, we will also be enabling billing, however we will be temporary suspending some of the free limitations, in order to let people get going. During beta, URL's will still have .v2. in the URL Warning During the beta, we will be testing our Disaster Recovery procedures, these will be notified on our StatusPage, and we will try selecting times with least disruption. Production (Q1 2019) \u00b6 When going into Production, we will do a full migration of ALL apps, users etc. From Cloud 1 to Cloud 2. A time for this will be announced on our StatusPage, and a time with least disruption will be selected for this. Important It's important to know that apps migrated from Cloud 1 to Cloud 2 will need to undergo some code changes before being Cloud 2 compliant. Apps will be migrated and will work on Cloud 2, however before they can be deployed, there need to be done some changes to the code. This will be shown on the application page after migration, and we will write extensive documentation on what changes that will be required.","title":"Roadmap"},{"location":"roadmap/#roadmap","text":"This roadmap will explain the process of each major release for Cloud 2.

To create a new project, click Create Project . After this the server will start creating on your Digital Ocean account. After it's created, our system will start bootstrapping it, and install some nice to have programs. Important To use SSH based git, make sure to add the SSH Public key shown above the form, to your git provider (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab etc.) Fill out the form and click Create On the first page, you can see logs etc. Under the Deploy configuration tab, you can see/edit the script used to deploy the app, and the supervisor configuration. Per default all apps are running through Supervisor. Note If you have multiple projects, make sure each have their own port (in the Supervisor configuration). You can easily change the port, default is 8000 . Port 8000 - 9000 are whitelisted in the Loadbalancer. This can be changed under Network Important First deploy can take a while, since it need to compile all dependencies. However after this, everything is cached for the project, and will go much faster. To get the project up and Running, simply hit Deploy now .
